context,"Fairlearn is a libarary to compute fairness of ML models. It has various fairness metrics. The dataset has been divided into 4 quartile ranges.Range_0 data: max_predicted_salary=3823.8262, min_predicted_salary=2972.1768demographic parity ratio=0.9046445393799978, Equalized Odds ratio=0.8975592686554106.Range_1 data: max_predicted_salary=4047.59, min_predicted_salary=3824.0066demographic parity ratio=0.925008461668641, Equalized Odds ratio=0.8276286966046001.Range_2 data: max_predicted_salary=4281.6704, min_predicted_salary=4047.7197demographic parity ratio=0.9469918552850651, Equalized Odds ratio=0.9364197530864196.Range_3 data: max_predicted_salary=5198.101, min_predicted_salary=4282.5933demographic parity ratio=0.9913055633212189, Equalized Odds ratio=0.9599224305106658.Overall database metrices: max_predicted_salary=5198.101, min_predicted_salary=2972.1768demographic parity ratio=0.9574437092771145, Equalized Odds ratio=0.9179382971653504. The interpretation of the values depend on the definitions as follows. Demographic Parity: It measures the ML model's ability to make prediction such that they are independent of the influence by sensitive groups. Equalized odds: It also ensures that ML model's predictions are independent of sensitive groups. It's more strict than Demographic parity by ensuring all groups in the dataset have same true positive rates and false positive rates. Equal Opportunity: It's similar to equalized odds but applies only to positive instances, i.e. Y=1. Demographic parity ratio: Ratio of selection rates between smallest and largest groups. Return type is a decimal value. A ratio of 1 means all groups have same selection rate. Equalized odds ratio: The equalized odds ratio of 1 means that all groups have the same true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative rates.  The sensitive feature considered here is the gender(male,female). Average salary for a feamle in the database is 4039.961815682968 and for a male is 4051.342103988367. Number of females in the database is 593 and number of males in the database is 2407."
